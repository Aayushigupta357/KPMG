DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Problem:
The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
-Customer Demographic 
-Customer Addresses
-Transactions data in the past 3 months

You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

Solution:
Notable data quality issues that were encountered and the methods used to mitigate the identified data inconsistencies are as follows. Furthermore, recommendations 
have been provided to avoid the reoccurrence of data quality issues and improve the accuracy of the underlying data used to drive business decisions.
● Additional customer_ids in the ‘Transactions table’ and ‘Customer Address table’ but not in ‘Customer Master (Customer Demographic)’
● Various columns, such as the brand of a purchase, or job title, have empty values in certain records
● Inconsistent values for the same attribute (e.g. Victoria being represented as “V”, “Vic” and “Victoria”)
● Inconsistent data type for the sameattribute (e.g. numeric values for some fields and strings for others)
