Data Insights 
*Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes*

Here is the task-
-Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers 
 should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

-In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 
 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

-Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities â€“ i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, 
 modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

-The PowerPoint presentation should includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each, 
 i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. 
 This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.
